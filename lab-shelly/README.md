======

# Overview

ngAdventure is a text-based adventure game that allows players to select from a dropdown form and navigate between rooms. The player stats and game history are displayed on the page.

This lab builds on coursework in Angular JS, particularly components, services, custom directives, controllers, and dependency injection. Both controllers and services contain business logic; however, unlike controllers, services are reusable in other parts of an application and independent from the view.
